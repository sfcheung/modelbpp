# modelbpp: Model posterior probability and related measures

This package is for assessing model uncertainty in structural
equation modeling (SEM) by using BIC posterior
probabilities, AIC weight (to be added), and similar measures and
fitting neighboring models. The package name, `modelbpp`,
stands for `model` `b`ayesian `p`osterior `p`ability.
