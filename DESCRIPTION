Description: Fits the neighboring models of a fitted
    structural equation model and assesses the model
    uncertainty of the fitted model. Currently supports
    BIC posterior probabilities (Wu, Cheung, and Leung,
    2020, <doi:10.1080/00273171.2019.1574546>) but may
    support other measures in the future.
